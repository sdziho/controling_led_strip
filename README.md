# Controling RGB led strip with arduino
In this project, we will make led strip controling with TV remote controller. 
The idea is to create a program that will automatically change the color by default and the ability to select the color manually.
  
As the name suggest, there are 3 types of diodes built in RGB strip; red (R), green (G) and blue (B).
Each of the colors is coded with number from 0 to 255 and represents intesity of light (0 - the lowest intesity, 255 - the highest intesity).
Combination of these 3 colors could give 16,777,216 combinations of different colors.
